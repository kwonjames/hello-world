# hello-world

Hello people!

I'm James, an Architectural Design Bachelors graduate who fell in love with computers and design, rather than buildings and design. Still in love with the process, but found my laptop and websites to be sexier than the ROM.

I'm human so I don't work 24/7, so in my off time I like to doodle and play games (Valorant, League of Legends, and any cozy multiplayer game).

Send me a message, or just creep me on my social media. If you like any of my IG posts that are older than a month, I'll get the hint and send you a message first ;).
